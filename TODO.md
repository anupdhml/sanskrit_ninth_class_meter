# TODOs

### Meter

* Write custom implementation to analyze meter, and see if it matches the one from vedaweb
* Use above to determine which syllable in the pada our stem formant occurs

### Validation

* Ensure root attestations match the text specified by whitney (eg: as doesn't seem to?)
* Check for None / null columns
* No of stanza attestations per stem is the same as the total attestation counts recorded in `df_roots`

### Analysis

* Send all the final data to ES and explore easily from there

### Cosmetics

* Readable labels on pada and stanza strata
* Rename root/stem data columns to be prefixed with root/stem
* Reorder columns
* Break this monolith notebook into multiple ones

### Others
